  Features:
  
  Operators fully functional
  Parenthesis functions including
  multiplication and others.
  
  React Hook used is useState
  but if we can make it cleaner,
  we can use useReduce instead.
  
  To run it on your local machine clone into the repo, then type: 

    npm install && npm start
